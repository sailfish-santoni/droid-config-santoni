# A temporary *very hacky* solution to enable call audio from earpiece and loudspeaker during voice calls.
# To launch (as nemo): "chmod +x callaudiod.sh && ./callaudiod.sh &"
# Requires a custom RPM package for pulseaudio-modules-droid e.g. https://git.io/fjDjt

# Oh and yes, Huong Tram is my favorite singer.
